# Monitoring example

These are configuration files for monitoring Tiled with Prometheus and Grafana.

To see a complete working example that incorporates these, clone the tiled
repository and, from the repository root directory, run:

```
TILED_SINGLE_USER_API_KEY=secret docker-compose up
```

These configuration files can be used as is or as a jumping off point for
integrating Tiled into larger systems.
