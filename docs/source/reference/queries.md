# Queries

## Built in query types

These can be used in searches, as in

```python
c.search(FullText("hello"))
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

   tiled.queries.Comparison
   tiled.queries.Contains
   tiled.queries.Eq
   tiled.queries.FullText
   tiled.queries.Regex
```

## Query expressions

The `Key` object can be used to construct queries in a readable way using
standard Python comparison operators, as in

```python
Key("color") == "red"
Key("temperature") > 300
```

used in searches like

```python
c.search(Key("color") == "red").search(Key("temperature") > 300)
```

Notice that, to compound searches, you may use repeated calls to `.search()` as in

```python
c.search(...).search(...).search(...)
```

````{warning}

**Do not use queries with the Python keywords `and` or `or`.**

In Python, `and` and `or` have a particular behavior:

```python
>>> 3 or 5
3

>>> 3 and 5
5
```

which would result in the first or last query being used, respectively,
ignoring all others. This is an unavoidable consequence of Python semantics,
so you just have to know not to mix queries with `and` and `or`.

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

   tiled.queries.Key
```
