# Structures

Tiled describes data in one of a fixed group of standard *structure families*.
These are *not* Python-specific structures. They can be encoded in standard,
language-agnostic formats and transferred from the service to a client in
potentially any language.

## Supported structure families

The structure families are:

* array --- a strided array, like a [numpy](https://numpy.org) array
* sparse --- a sparse array (i.e. an array which is mostly zeros)
* dataframe --- tabular data, as in [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) or
  [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* container --- a of other structures, akin to a dictionary or a directory

Support for sparse arrays and [Awkward Array](https://awkward-array.org/) are
planned.

## How structure is encoded

Tiled can describe a structure---its shape, chunking, labels, and so on---for
the client so that the  client can intelligently request the pieces that it
wants.

The structures encodings are designed to be as unoriginal as possible, using
established standards and, where some invention is required, using established
names from numpy, pandas/Arrow, and dask.

Some structures are encoded in two parts:

* **Macrostructure** --- This is the high-level structure including things like
  shape, chunk shape, number of partitions, and column names. This structure
  *has meaning to the server* and shows up in the HTTP API.
* **Microstructure** --- This is low-level structure including things like
  machine data type(s) and partition boundary locations. It enables the
  service-side Adapter to communicate to the client how to interpret the bytes
  that represent a given "tile" of data.

## Examples

These examples were generated by serving the demo tree

```
tiled serve pyobject --public tiled.examples.generated:tree
```

making an HTTP request with [httpie](https://httpie.io/)
and then extracting the portion of interest with
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), as shown below.

### Array (single chunk)

An array is described with a shape, chunk sizes, and a data type.
The parameterization and spelling of the data type follows the
[numpy `__array_interface__` protocol](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.interface.html#object.__array_interface__).
Both built-in data types and
[strucuted data types](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html) are supported.


An optional field, `dims` ("dimensions") may contain a list with
a string label for each dimension.

This `(10, 10)`-shaped array fits in a single `(10, 10)`-shaped chunk.

```
$ http :8000/metadata/small_image | jq .data.attributes.structure
```

```json
{
  "macro": {
    "chunks": [
      [
        100
      ],
      [
        100
      ]
    ],
    "shape": [
      100,
      100
    ],
    "dims": null,
    "resizable": false
  },
  "micro": {
    "endianness": "little",
    "kind": "f",
    "itemsize": 8
  }
}
```

### Array (multiple chunks)

This `(10000, 10000)`-shaped array is subdivided into 4 Ã— 4 = 16 chunks,
`(2500, 2500)`. Chunks do *not* in general have to be equally-sized,
which is why the size of each chunk is given explicitly.

```
$ http :8000/metadata/big_image | jq .data.attributes.structure
```

```json
{
  "macro": {
    "chunks": [
      [
        2500,
        2500,
        2500,
        2500
      ],
      [
        2500,
        2500,
        2500,
        2500
      ]
    ],
    "shape": [
      10000,
      10000
    ],
    "dims": null,
    "resizable": false
  },
  "micro": {
    "endianness": "little",
    "kind": "f",
    "itemsize": 8
  }
}
```

### Array (with a structured data type)

This is a 1D array where each item has internal structure,
as in numpy's [strucuted data types](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html)

```
$ http :8000/metadata/structured_data/pets | jq .data.attributes.structure
```

```json
{
  "macro": {
    "chunks": [
      [
        2
      ]
    ],
    "shape": [
      2
    ],
    "dims": null,
    "resizable": false
  },
  "micro": {
    "itemsize": 48,
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "name",
        "dtype": {
          "endianness": "little",
          "kind": "U",
          "itemsize": 40
        },
        "shape": null
      },
      {
        "name": "age",
        "dtype": {
          "endianness": "little",
          "kind": "i",
          "itemsize": 4
        },
        "shape": null
      },
      {
        "name": "weight",
        "dtype": {
          "endianness": "little",
          "kind": "f",
          "itemsize": 4
        },
        "shape": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Sparse Array

There are a variety of ways to represent
[sparse arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix).
The [Coordinate list (COO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Coordinate_list_(COO))
layout consists of writing the coordinate (e.g. row, column, or N-dimensional position)
and value of each nonzero element. A N-dimensional COO array with M nonzero
elements is described by an NxM array of coordinates and a length-M array of values.

Tiled describes this as a chunked array where each chunk contains a table
of coordinates and their values. The data types within each table are not described
at this level; they are self-described by the individual chunk payloads.

The key `layout` is always set to `COO` currently. In the future if other sparse
representations are supported, this key will be used to indicate which is used.

```json
{
  "shape": [
    100,
    100
  ],
  "chunks": [
    [
      100
    ],
    [
      100
    ]
  ],
  "dims": null,
  "resizable": false
}
```

### DataFrame

With dataframes, we speak of "partitions" instead of "chunks". There are a
couple important distinctions. We always know the size of chunk before we ask
for it, but we will not know the number of rows in a partition until we
actually read it and enumerate them. Therefore, we cannot slice into
dataframes the same way that we can slice in to arrays. We can ask for a
subset of the *columns*, and we can fetch partitions one at a time in any
order, but we cannot make requests like "rows 100-200". (Dask has the same
limitation, for the same reason.)

```
$ http :8000/metadata/long_table | jq .data.attributes.structure
```

```json
{
  "macro": {
    "npartitions": 5,
    "columns": [
      "A",
      "B",
      "C"
    ],
    "resizable": false
  },
  "micro": {
    "meta": "data:application/vnd.apache.arrow.file;base64,...",
    "divisions": "data:application/vnd.apache.arrow.file;base64,...",
  }
}
```

Notice that the microstructure contains base64-encoded data.
The correct way to encode dataframes and their data types in a cross-language
way is with Apache Arrow.  Apache Arrow is a binary format. It explicitly
does not support JSON.  (There is a JSON implementation, but the documentation
states that it is intended only for integration testing and should not be used
by external code.) Therefore, when JSON is requested, we base64-encode it.
When binary msgpack is requested instead of JSON, we pack the binary data directly.

The microstructure has two parts:

* `meta` --- This contains the names and data types of the columns and index. To
  generate this we build a dataframe with zero rows in it but the same columns
  and indexes as the original, and then serialize that with Arrow.
* `divisions` --- This contains the index values that delineate each partition.
  We generate this in a similar way.

Both of the concepts (and their names) are borrowed directly from
dask.dataframe. They should enable any client, including in languages other than
Python, to perform the same function.

### Container

This structure is a container for other structures. It may be compared to a
directory, a JSON object, a Python dictionary, or an HDF5 Group. Containers may
contain other containers, any other structure, or a mixture.

Some may contain a small number of nodes, easy to list in a single request,
while others may contain many listed via multiple paginated requests. Some Tiled
deployments currently in use have containers with up to hundreds of thousands
of nodes.

Typically, a container's structure tell us only how many nodes it contains (`count`).
The `contents` key is typically set to `null`, which indicates that we will need
a separate request to fetch information about each child node.

```json
{
  "contents": null,
  "count": 2
}
```

In certain cases, it is efficient to in-line all the information about the
container's contents (their metadata, structure, and more) in a single
response.


```json
{
  "contents": {
    "lat": {
      "attributes": {
        "ancestors": [
