        tree:
          type: string
          description: |
            Type of tree to serve. This may be:

            - The string `files`, a shorthand for serving a directory of files.
            - An import path to a Tree *instance*.
            - An import path to a callable (function or type) that returns a
              Tree. For these, the `args:` parameter below must be used as well.

            In an import path, packages/modules are separated by dots,
            and the object itself it separated by a colon.

            Examples:

                # Tree instances
                tiled.examples.generated_minimal:tree
                tiled examples.generated:tree
                my_python_module:my_tree_instance

                # Callables that return Tree instances
                tiled.trees.files:Tree.from_directory
                my_python_module:CustomTree

        path:
          type: string
          description: |
            URL subpath for to serve this Tree on.
            A good default choice is `"/"` if you are serving
            one Tree.

          type: [object, "null"]

          description: |
            If `tree:` is set to `files` or some callable that returns a
            Tree, this parameter must be included. It may contain named
            arguments to pass to the callable. It may be empty or `null` if the
            callable requires no arguments.

            Example:

            ```yaml
            - path: "/"
              tree: tiled.trees.files:Tree.from_directory
              args:

            If this is set (not null) then an authenticator must also be set.

            Example:

            ```yaml
            access_control:
              access_policy: "tiled.trees.in_memory:SimpleAccessPolicy"

          These are typically from the tiled.authenticators module,
          though user-defined ones may be used as well.

          This is given as an import path. In an import path, packages/modules
          are separated by dots, and the object itself it separated by a colon.

          Example:

          Two equally good ways to generate a secure secret...

          With ``openssl``:

              openssl rand -hex 32

          This controls how often fresh access token have to be

          An *access* token cannot be revoked, so its lifetime should be short. The
          default is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
          
          Units are **seconds**.
