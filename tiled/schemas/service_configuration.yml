        catalog:
          type: string
          description: |
            Type of catalog to serve. This may be:

            - The string `files`, a shorthand for serving a directory of files.
            - An import path to a Catalog *instance*.
            - An import path to a callable (function or type) that returns a
              Catalog. For these, the `args:` parameter below must be used as well.

            In an import path, packages/modules are separated by dots,
            and the object itself it separated by a colon.

            Examples:

                # Catalog instances
                tiled.examples.generated_minimal:catalog
                tiled examples.generated:demo
                my_python_module:my_catalog_instance

                # Callables that return Catalog instances
                tiled.catalogs.files:Catalog.from_directory
                my_python_module:CustomCatalog

        path:
          type: string
          description: |
            URL subpath for to serve this Catalog on.
            A good default choice is `"/"` if you are serving
            one Catalog.
        args:
          type: [object, "null"]
          additionalProperties: true
          description: |
            If `catalog:` is set to `files` or some callable that returns a
            Catalog, this parameter must be included. It may contain named
            arguments to pass to the callable. It may be empty or `null` if the
            callable requires no arguments.

            Example:

            ```yaml
            - path: "/"
              catalog: tiled.catalogs.files:Catalog.from_directory
              args:
                directory: "path/to/files"
            ```

    additionalProperties: false
    properties:
      authenticator:
        type: string
        description: |
          Type of Authenticator to use.
          
          These are typically from the tiled.authenticators module,
          though user-defined ones may be used as well.

          This is given as an import path. In an import path, packages/modules
          are separated by dots, and the object itself it separated by a colon.

          Example:

          ```yaml
          authenticator: tiled.examples.DummyAuthenticator
          ```
      args:
        type: [object, "null"]
        description: |
          Named arguments to pass to Authenticator. If there are none,
          `args` may be omitted or empty.
    
          Example:

          ```yaml
          authenticator: tiled.examples.PAMAuthenticator
          args:
            service: "custom_service"
          ```

          When generating a secret, is important to produce a difficult-to-guess
          random number, and make it different each time you start up a server.
          Two equally good ways to generate a secure secret...

          With ``openssl``:

              openssl rand -hex 32

          With ``python``:

              python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

          This controls how often fresh access token have to be
          re-issued. The process is transparent to the user and just affects performance.
          An *access* token cannot be revoked, so its lifetime should be short. The
          default is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
          
          Units are **seconds**.

        description: |
          Even *active* sessions are timed out after this
          limit, and the user is required to resubmit credentials. By default,
          this is unset and active session are never shut down.
