    description: |
      URI of a Tiled OAuth2 authentication server. If this is unset, `uri` will
      be used for authentication as well, which is typically correct for simple
      deployments of Tiled.

      By default, `tiled serve ...` acts is both a Resource server and an
      Authentication server.

      Client to read structure into.
      Default ("numpy") uses numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, and xarrays backed
      by numpy arrays.

      ```yaml
      structure_clients: "numpy"
      ```

      The "dask" option uses the dask-based analogues of
      these.

      ```yaml
      structure_clients: "dask"
      ```

      To use custom clients, map each structure family you want to support
      to an import path:

      ```yaml
      structure_clients:
        array: "package.module:CustomArrayClient"
        dataframe: "package.module:CustomDataFrameClient"
      ```
  special_clients:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      Use this to dispatch handling of structures that are marked with a given "spec"
      to a special class.

      ```yaml
      special_clients:
        some_spec: "package.module:CustomClient"
      ```
  cache:

    additionalProperties: false
    properties:
      # These properties are mutually exclusive, but encoding this
      # in jsonschema is complex and therefore in tension with the goal
      # of this file stated at the top. The mutual exclusion *is* enforced,
      # but in the Python code that parses the profiles, not here.
      memory:

        properties:
          available_bytes:
            type: number
            description: |
              Maximum memory (in bytes) that the cache may consume.

              For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
              Example:

              ```yaml
              available_bytes: 2_000_000_000  # 2GB
              ```

          error_if_full:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              By default, the cache starts evicting the least-used items when
              it fills up. This is generally fine when working with a
              connection to the server. But if the goal is to cache for
              *offline* use, it is better to be notified by and error that the
              cache is full. Then the user can respond by increasing
              available_bytes, using a different storage volume for the cache,
              or choosing to a different (smaller) set of entries to download.
      disk:
        type: object
        required:

        properties:

            type: string
            description: |
              A directory will be created at this path if it does not yet exist.
              It is safe to reuse an existing cache directory and to share a cache
              directory between multiple processes.
              available_bytes:
          available_bytes:
            type: number

              Maximum storage space (in bytes) that the cache may consume.

              For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
              Example:

              ```yaml

          cull_on_startup:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              If reusing an existing cache directory which is already larger than the
              available_bytes, an error is raised. Set this to True to delete
              items from the cache until it fits in available_bytes. False by default.
  token_cache:
    type: string
    description: |
      Filepath to directory of access tokens.
      Default location is usually suitable.
      The default is system-dependent and can be inspected at
      `tiled.client.authentication.DEFAULT_TILED_TOKEN_CACHE`.
  verify:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to False to disable SSL verification.
