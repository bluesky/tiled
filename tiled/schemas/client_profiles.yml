      Client to read structure into.
      Default ("numpy") uses numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, and xarrays backed
      by numpy arrays.

      ```yaml
      structure_clients: "numpy"
      ```

      The "dask" option uses the dask-based analogues of
      these.

      ```yaml
      structure_clients: "dask"
      ```

      To use custom clients, map each structure family or spec you want to support
      to an import path:

      ```yaml
      structure_clients:
        array: "package.module:CustomArrayClient"
        dataframe: "package.module:CustomDataFrameClient"
        my_custom_spec: "package.module:CUstomClient"
      ```

      # These properties are mutually exclusive, but encoding this
      # in jsonschema is complex and therefore in tension with the goal
      # of this file stated at the top. The mutual exclusion *is* enforced,
      # but in the Python code that parses the profiles, not here.

            description: |
              Maximum memory (in bytes) that the cache may consume.

              For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
              Example:

              ```yaml
              available_bytes: 2_000_000_000  # 2GB
              ```

            description: |
              A directory will be created at this path if it does not yet exist.
              It is safe to reuse an existing cache directory and to share a cache
              directory between multiple processes.
              available_bytes:
          capacity:
            type: number
            description: |
              Maximum storage space (in bytes) that the cache may consume.

              For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
              Example:

              ```yaml
              available_bytes: 2_000_000_000  # 2GB
              ```

  token_cache:
    type: string
    description: |
      Filepath to directory of access tokens.
      Default location is usually suitable.
      The default is system-dependent and can be inspected at
      `tiled.client.context.DEFAULT_TOKEN_CACHE`.
  verify:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to False to disable SSL verification.
