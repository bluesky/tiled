    # We need to consider:
    #
    # * FastAPI may be behind a load balancer, such that for a client request
    #   like "https://example.com/..." the Host header is set to something
    #   like "localhost:8000" and the request.url.scheme is "http".
    #   We consult X-Forwarded-* headers to get the original Host and scheme.
    #   Note that, although these are a de facto standard, they may not be
    #   set by default. With nginx, for example, they need to be configured.
    #
    # * The client may be connecting through SSH port-forwarding. (This
    #   is a niche use case but one that we nonetheless care about.)
    #   The Host or X-Forwarded-Host header may include a non-default port.
    #   The HTTP spec specifies that the Host header may include a port
    #   to specify a non-default port.
