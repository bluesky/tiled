      Client to read structure into.
      Default ("numpy") uses numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, and xarrays backed
      by numpy arrays.

      ```yaml
      structure_clients: "numpy"
      ```

      The "dask" option uses the dask-based analogues of
      these.

      ```yaml
      structure_clients: "dask"
      ```

      To use custom clients, map each structure family or spec you want to support
      to an import path:

      ```yaml
      structure_clients:
        array: "package.module:CustomArrayClient"
        dataframe: "package.module:CustomDataFrameClient"
        my_custom_spec: "package.module:CUstomClient"
      ```
  cache:

    additionalProperties: false
    properties:
      filepath:
        type: string
        description: |
          Location of cache file on disk.
          Default location is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tiled/http_response_cache.db`.
      capacity:
        type: number
        description: |
          Maximum size (in bytes) that the cache may allocate for response bodies.
          The total size of a cache may be slightly higher. Default is 500 MB.

          For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
          Example:

          ```yaml
          capacity: 500_000_000  # 500 MB
          ```

      max_item_size:
        type: number
        description: |
          Maximum size (in bytes) of any individual cached response body.
          This limit is designed to prevent one a couple very large responses from
          using up the entire capacity.

          For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
          Example:

          ```yaml
          capacity: 500_000  # 500 kB
          ```

      readonly:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Open the cache in read-only mode.
          Do not add, remove, or update contents.
  timeout:
    description: |
      Configure timeouts for the HTTP client.

      Tiled sets read and write timeouts very high (30 seconds) by default to
      accommodate pulling ~100 MB chunks over a slow network connection.

      Units are seconds.

  token_cache:
    type: string
    description: |
      Filepath to directory of access tokens.
      Default location is usually suitable. It is in the tokens
      subdirectory of `TILED_CACHE_DIR`, which is
      system-dependent and can be inspected at
      `tiled.client.context.TILED_CACHE_DIR`.
  verify:
    type: boolean

      Set to False to disable SSL verification.
